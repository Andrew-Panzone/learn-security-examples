- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

The secure code includes an error handling mechanism that catches exceptions during the
execution of the database query. This addition improves the robustness of the application by
ensuring that it does not crash when encountering invalid input or other errors during database
operations. Specifically, if an invalid _id is provided that causes a query execution error
(for instance, a casting error if the ID does not match the expected format for MongoDB ObjectIds),
the catch block will handle the exception and respond with a 'Bad input' message.

The vulnerability in the initial code was the potential for NoSQL injection,
where malicious users could exploit the application's direct use of user input in database queries
to manipulate the query or access unauthorized data.

The addition of a try-catch block around the database query mitigates the risk of the server
crashing due to unhandled exceptions (e.g., invalid ObjectId formats), but it does not directly
address NoSQL injection vulnerabilities. To specifically prevent NoSQL injection, you would need
to validate and sanitize the input to ensure it conforms to expected patterns or types before using
it in a query.

Additional Security Mechanisms

Input Validation: Validate the id to ensure it matches the expected format
(a 24-character hex string for MongoDB ObjectIds) before executing the query.

Limiting Data Exposure: Avoid sending raw database objects directly to the user, as this may
inadvertently expose sensitive information or implementation details. Instead, selectively send
only the necessary information.
