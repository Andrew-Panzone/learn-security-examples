Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does tampering violate?
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the vulnerable version the application takes user input (username from the query string) and
directly uses it in a database query without any form of validation or sanitation.
This is problematic because a malicious user could craft a username that manipulates the query
to perform unintended actions, such as unauthorized data access.

The secure version introduces two key defenses against NoSQL injection:

Input Validation: It checks if the username is a string. This simple check ensures that
structured query objects are not accepted as valid input, preventing a wide range of injection
attacks that rely on passing objects or arrays.

Input Sanitization: The code sanitizes the username by removing non-alphanumeric characters with
the regex /[^\w\s]/gi. This further restricts the attacker's ability to inject malicious query
operators or scripts, as many injection techniques rely on special characters to modify the query
structure or execute code.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CIA Property Violated
The vulnerability primarily violates the Confidentiality and Integrity aspects of the CIA
(Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) triad:

Confidentiality is compromised because an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access
to sensitive information stored in the database.

Integrity is at risk because the attacker could manipulate database queries to alter data.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional Security Mechanisms

Use Parameterized Queries: Always use parameterized queries or ORM/ODM methods that inherently
handle input safely and prevent injection.

Implement Rate Limiting: To prevent brute force attacks, rate limiting on sensitive endpoints can
reduce the attack surface.

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): For sensitive actions, require a second form of verification.
This doesn't directly impact the vulnerability in question but adds an additional security layer.
