The vulnerability in the first code snippet lies in its flawed authentication and authorization
checks for updating a user's role. It relies on client-supplied data (userId from the request body)
to identify the user attempting the action and to check if they have the 'admin' role required for
authorization.

The secure version introduces session-based authentication, which significantly improves security.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Role-based Access Control (RBAC): Implement a more granular role-based access control system that
explicitly defines permissions for different roles within the application.

Input Validation: Always validate and sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks. Even though
the revised code addresses the authentication and authorization flaw, ensuring that inputs like
userId and newRole are of expected types and formats can prevent other types of vulnerabilities.

HTTPS: Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, protecting session IDs and other sensitive information
from being intercepted.

Secure Session Configuration: Ensure sessions are configured securely by setting the httpOnly and
secure flags for cookies, which prevent access to session cookies via JavaScript and ensure cookies
are only sent over HTTPS, respectively.

Session Timeout: Implement session expiration or timeouts to reduce the risk of session hijacking.
